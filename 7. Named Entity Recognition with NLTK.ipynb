    "# Named Entity Recognition with NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most major forms of chunking in natural language processing is called \"Named Entity Recognition.\" The idea is to have the machine immediately be able to pull out \"entities\" like people, places, things, locations, monetary figures, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a bit of a challenge, but NLTK is this built in for us. There are two major options with NLTK's named entity recognition: either recognize all named entities, or recognize named entities as their respective type, like people, places, locations, etc."

When Binary is False, it picked up the same things, but wound up splitting up terms like White House into \"White\" and \"House\" as if they were different, whereas we could see in the binary = True option, the named entity recognition was correct to say White House was part of the same named entity.\n",
